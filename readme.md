# Embrionix devices monitoring using Grafana and Prometheus

**Note: This is a proof of concept**

The monitor tool contains 4 major container images:
* ionixmon: Main webpage for registering and monitoring devices.  One container will be spawned on host per monitored device.
* Prometheus: Datalogging server
* Grafana: Main UI
* prometheus_interface: Docker image with scripts to monitor Embrionix devices

Prerequisites:
* A running Docker instance with docker-compose installed
* Internet access for deployment (In order to fetch Docker images)	

Quickstart:
1. From the checkout folder (At the same level as the docker-compose.yml file), run 'sudo docker-compose up -d'.
1. From the same folder as in previous step, build the monitoring docker image, run 'sudo docker build -t prometheus_interface PrometheusMonitoring/devicemonitor/prometheus_interface'
1. Using a web browser, connect to http://127.0.0.1:8060 and add the device to monitor
1. Connect to prometheus target page on: http://127.0.0.1:9090/targets, verify that your target is up
1. Open Graphana on 127.0.0.1:3000 with a web browser (Default user/password is admin/admin)

Todo:
* Complete ionixmon navigation page, embed graphs & improve UI
* Alarms
* Allow for monitor container removal
* Cleanup docker networks
* Merge script with capabilites from feature/all_flows
