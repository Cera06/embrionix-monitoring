The monitor tool contains 4 container images:
* ionixmon: 127.0.0.1:8060: Main webpage for registering and monitoring devices.  One container will be spawned on host per monitored device.
* Prometheus: 127.0.0.1:9090: Datalogging server
* Grafana: 127.0.0.1:3000: Main UI
* prometheus_interface: Docker image with scripts to monitor Embrionix devices.  Metrics are shown on monitor docker container ip port 10600.

Prerequisites:
* Docker: https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop
* Docker-Compose: https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/
* Internet access for deployment (In order to fetch Docker images)	

Quickstart:
1. From the checkout folder (At the same level as the docker-compose.yml file), run 'sudo docker build -t prometheus_interface PrometheusMonitoring/devicemonitor/prometheus_interface'.
1. From the same folder as in previous step, build the monitoring docker image, run 'sudo docker-compose up -d --build'
1. Using a web browser, connect to http://127.0.0.1:8060 and add the device to monitor in the top bar menu
1. You can do a quick monitor on the 127.0.0.1:8060 page by checking graphs
1. For deeper analysis, use Graphana on 127.0.0.1:3000 with a web browser (Default user/password is admin/admin)

Tested OS:
* Ubuntu 16.04/18.04
* Windows 10

Todo:
* Alarms
* Allow for monitor container removal
* Cleanup docker networks
* Use one container for monitoring instead of spawning one for each monitor threads
* Support syslog
* Device overview
* Load test
* Merge script with capabilites from feature/all_flows
